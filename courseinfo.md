## Policies

In general, I'll be treating you like autonomous adults, which does mean you have plenty of rope to hang yourself. There are a few things we need to make explicit though -


### Accessing Me (The Instructor)

You will have access to me at The Iron Yard campus during lecture/workshop hours, Slack (you will learn about this on Day 1), and email (that order is probably the quickest way to get to me... and Slack is on my phone, so basically like texting me). I plan on being available 15-20 minutes before class for major issues that will keep you from following along (example: something wrong with your computer or Xcode).

### Attendance

Attendance is expected every day class is in session, but not required. If you miss more than **4** days, your job placement may be forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast. Also, be on time, or better, be early. When you're late, even by a few minutes, it's hard to catch up. It's unfair to you, and it's unfair to the other students. Being late 2 times in one week counts as an absence.

### Daily Schedule (Weeks 1-9)

_Monday-Thursday_

     9am - 12pm Lecture
     1pm - 5pm Lab

_Friday_

     9am Huddle
     10am - 4pm Lab
     4pm - 5?pm **#IRONPINTS**

Starting on Week 10, you'll be working on your final projects and we'll have a different schedule (much more Friday-like). Still gotta be here at 9am though ;)

There's a chance we'll have guest lecturers, field trips, and other fun stuff during the class that'll alter this schedule significantly on some days. Don't set your watch by it.

### Coursework

Homework will be assigned daily, and often reviewed the next day. It is your responsibility to be sure you're keeping up with the homework and seek out help if you're struggling.

The course will culminate in a large capstone project, the topics of which should be narrowed down by the end of week 8 and decided by the end of week 9. The last weeks of class will focus mostly on preparing those, with lectures being tailored to the needs of the projects. I'd encourage everyone to start thinking about what they'd like to accomplish here, as this project will likely be the anchor of your portfolio and an important part of your hiring success after graduation.

As much as possible, we'll try to steer earlier lectures towards areas of interest, so feel free to suggest other projects earlier.

## Topics

Here's a tree of iOS-related topics (from [Everything a Competent iOS Developer Needs to Know](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/everything-a-competent-ios-developer-needs-to-know)). We probably won't cover every leaf, but we will at least visit each branch.
