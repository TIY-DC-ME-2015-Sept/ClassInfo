## Class Philosophy

So you've decided to become a programmer. Great! Welcome to the club. If you're reading this, then we think -- no, we **know** -- that you're capable of completing this course. You are capable of learning and using everything that you'll need to make amazing and beautiful things, and you are capable of becoming a professional software engineer at an organization that both respects and nurtures your talent soon after graduation.

There's a few things that I want you understand before setting out on this crazy journey. Keep in them in mind as you alternate between struggle and success.

### You Deserve To Be Here

As of today, literally right now, **you are an engineer.** Say it out loud. Be proud of it! The fact that you've committed the next several months of your life towards learning this craft (and it is a craft) means that you are dedicated to it; you will simply learn the same lessons that others have learned to get to where they are.

There is no magical light that turns on at some point that lets you or others know that you've achieved some base level of competency. There is no examination or qualification that grants you access to call yourself a programmer or coder or developer or engineer. You, and I, and everyone else in this industry are all peers from the moment you decided to join us.

The only difference between us is experience. I've been doing this (mobile) for about 6 years (and programming for almost 25 years) -- often quite poorly! I have experience, you don't (yet). That's all. My role in this class is to pass on my experience and knowledge on to you in a way that dramatically accelerates your own skill acquisition. My goal over the next three months is to get you to where I was after a year and a half. 

I'm not a wizard, and I'm sure as hell not smarter than you. Believing that I am denies your own inherent talent, and closes doors in your mind that you'll eventually need to walk through.

### There Are No Stupid Questions

Over the next three months, your role in this program is to learn. Embrace that. Be talkative, be involved, be curious, and be questioning.

Here's a promise: **As your instructor, I promise to answer every question you have.** I might table your question for later, or respond with a clarifying question that I'd like for you to research, but there is no such thing as a "dumb question." In my experience, there are two outcomes from someone asking a question that they think should be simple:

* I answer it in five seconds and it illuminates a ton of information for the asker (and probably two or three other people that are listening), or...
* It leads to a great discussion and *everyone* comes away smarter.

### Manage Your Stress

We want to give you as much as you can handle during this time; no more and no less. We'll talk about this a lot during the course, but managing your stress and emotional health is paramount. Burnout is your enemy.

The daily assignment deadline is at 2am before the next class begins; this is an intentional decision to encourage you to get some sleep. Being attentive and switched on during lecture, where we'll discuss any problems that many of your fellow students had during the preceding homework, will be of more use than pulling an all nighter.

If you feel like you're starting to fall behind, **please** talk with us before panicking. We give regular, real talk progress updates to all of our students, and I'm happy to give review instruction.

Taking an intensive course like this can be like nothing else you ever do. Besides family, it should be the most important thing in your life for the next three months. That said, it should not be the only thing, and it should be fun.

### Respect

[Code School Manifesto](http://masondesu.github.io/code-school-manifesto/)

If there's anything resembling a golden rule at The Iron Yard, it's "Don't Be An Asshole." This is deserving further explanation, though.

First and foremost: The Iron Yard is committed to creating safe environments for learning. To quote [Lambda Jam's Diversity Policy](http://www.lambdajam.com/policies.html), this means a safe environment for "people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification." If at any time something or someone makes you feel uncomfortable, contact any of the instructors, the Campus Director, or any Iron Yard staff member at any campus privately and we'll help.

All of our students will come to the class with different academic and professional backgrounds; all of our students will learn at different paces. The Iron Yard is dedicated to helping everyone learn to best of their capabilities. This means "don't compare yourself with other students." 

If you understand some course materials that someone else is struggling with, be mindful not to act in ways that may discourage them. (Think back to a time in your life when you were challenged by something, and remember how acutely you perceived any subtle signs of frustration or disappointment.) Instead, take it as an opportunity to sharpen your own knowledge and help them learn. If you can't teach something, you don't understand it well enough.
