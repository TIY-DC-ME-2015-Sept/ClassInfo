We've got [a lot](http://hijk.it/1F2Q0u1O0Q03) to cover and only a few short weeks to do so. I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common starting point and spend the time in the first class learning rather than getting setup and on the same page. That said, feel free to contact me with questions - learning how to ask for help is a very important skill.


## To Do’s

Review and complete the tasks below by the day before class.


## Setup Party

Note: The day before class, we will have a setup party to help you with many of these things. However, many of the downloads take a lot of time, so it would be best to have what you can at least downloaded (and preferably installed) before the class starts.

### 1. Get a Mac

You will need a Mac running at least OSX Yosemite (or El Capitan). You cannot compile native code for iOS without a Mac. If your Mac cannot effectively run Yosemite, you will need to acquire one that can or does.


### 2. Install OSX Yosemite (if you haven’t already)

* You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/). If you already have an iOS device, you probably already have an Apple ID.
* Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
* Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.

WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

NOTE: The public version of El Capitan comes out a little over a week after class begins. I strongly recommend you hold off on doing any upgrades (including to El Capitan) until after class is over. While it shouldn't cause any problems, it can, and I wouldn't want you to get behind because an install goes bad.


### 3. iOS Device

While the first couple weeks of class will not require a device, eventually you will need some form of an iOS device to continue testing and developing. For this class, we will not require a particular device, but it will be best if the device can effectively run iOS 9. Some suggested devices include:

* iPhone 5, 5C, & 5S
* iPhone 6, 6-Plus
* iPhone 6s, 6s-Plus
* iPod Touch 5th Gen or above
* iPad 2 or above
* iPad Air or iPad Air 2
* iPad mini

Early devices won’t work for much of the code in the class. While it is certainly not required (or even suggested) to have an Apple Watch or a new Apple TV, if you have one, you will be able to develop for the platform, if you want.

### 4. Install iOS 9 on the device(s), if you haven’t already

* Go to Settings, General, Software Update on your device to make sure you have the latest version. If not, it can be installed from there. It’s best to be plugged into power and allow plenty of time for the update to complete.


### 5. Download & Install the latest version of Xcode

* Go to the [Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) to download and install the latest _release_ version of Xcode. Do _not_ install the pre-release version, if there is one. Please make sure you have lots of Internet bandwidth and allow plenty of time for this download. It is generally a very large download. After getting the current version, do NOT update to a newer version. We will want to all be on the same version in class. If we decide to update to a newer version, we will all do it together.

The current version that you should have installed is: Xcode 7 GM Seed. Do not install 7.1 Beta (or any Beta version). Any upgrades will be done as a class.

### 6. Sign up for a free Apple Developer account

* While initially you can write some code, eventually you will need a developer account to test your code on a device and/or send it to the App Store for distribution. The Xcode simulator will not be enough for testing after just a couple weeks of coding.
* Go to the [Apple Developer Site](https://developer.apple.com/register/) to sign up for your account. As an individual developer, you will want to use your existing Apple ID, assuming you have one for iTunes. If you’ve never bought anything from iTunes, never had an Apple device, never bought anything from Apple online, and you don’t have an Apple ID, then you will want to create one.
* While the prompts will allow you to create a free account, you will need a PAID developer account if you want to launch your app. The cost is $99/year. That allows you to submit apps to the app store. With Xcode 7, Apple no longer requires a paid developer account to test apps on devices. However, you will need one to submit an app to the app store, so if you want you can go ahead and get it.


## Other Pre-Work

Besides getting your equipment setup which we will verify at the Setup Party, you will want to get going on a few other topics.

### 7. Typing

Believe it or not, a **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try http://www.keybr.com/). Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.


### 8. Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Developers use such tools both to track their own work as it changes over time, and to collaborate with other developers on larger projects. I use Git on _every_ non-trivial project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the first section of the Treehouse course (Why Version Control Matters) on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics). You will need to sign up for a free account. 
2. You do _not_ need to complete the other sections (Getting Started with Git all the way through Workflows). You can, if you want, but Xcode has easier ways of doing this than using the command line. So, we’ll learn what you need in class. Still, the concepts are good, so if you want to finish them, feel free.
3. Treehouse also has some interesting courses on iOS including Objective-C & Swift. I don’t believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn’t be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and some of these may be helpful as a future refresher, so I thought I’d point them out.
4. Don’t forget to delete your account, once you’ve completed what you want to complete, or you will get billed. You can, of course, keep it if you want.


### 9. GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git repositories. We will be hosting all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center of your open-source world for some time to come. In many circles, your Github profile _is_ your resume, and it should be created with that in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - something professional, if not exactly your name
2. Make sure to add a profile picture, your full name, and a valid public email address
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


### 10. SourceTree

Git is an important tool for developers, but using the command line can be difficult. Xcode has some tools built in that make it easier. GitHub has a free tool that is more powerful, but still not as easy as SourceTree. [SourceTree](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sourcetree-git-hg/id411678673?mt=12) is a powerful, yet mostly simple interface for interacting with Git projects. We'll use it in class almost daily, and you'll use it for submitting your homework.


### 11. Slack

Slack is a chat tool. We will use it extensively throughout class to communicate 1-to-1, among the whole class, between classes, and even with alumni. We'll use it to share information, share code, send files, and many other things. It is available for Mac, for mobile, and for web.

1. Download and Install [Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack/id803453959?ls=1&mt=12)
2. Get the team name from Su and use it create & sign in to your account


### 12. Other Software We Will Use Or Reference In Class

1. A Text Editor -  A few times in class you'll need a text editor (other than Xcode or TextEdit). I like [TextWrangler](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12). You may have another favorite if you've done other coding classes. You can use any text editor you want. If you don't have a favorite get TextWrangler.
2. An Image Editor - Photoshop is the mother of all image editors, but it's overkill (and crazy expensive) for this class. If you have it, great. If not, you can use your favorite image editor. I like [Pixelmator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12), but it doesn't matter as long as it can export PNGs with transparency
3. App Show - Apple recently allowed not only screenshots of apps, but also a short video. [App Show](https://www.techsmith.com/techsmith-appshow.html) from TechSmith will help you create it.
4. We may also use optional tools like Core Data Editor, Balsamiq, but we'll get those as we need them.
